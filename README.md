# Arduino IoT Training using ESP32

This code is for MQTT connection using ESP32 to HiveMQ MQTT public broker. This training will use ESP32 with Node-RED as an IoT middleware to communicate with Telegram, Web Dashboard and MySQL database.

## The hardware used here are :

1. ESP32
2. Temperature sensor: LM35

## Libraries used :
